 Deploying a Web Server on AWS with Terraform (Nginx + CloudWatch)

This project automates the deployment of a secure, monitored web server on AWS using Terraform. It provisions an EC2 instance, installs Nginx, sets up security groups, and configures CloudWatch for monitoring â€” all through code.

---

 ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Terraform â€“ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- AWS EC2 â€“ Virtual Linux server (Ubuntu)
- Nginx â€“ Web server (installed via `user_data`)
- CloudWatch Agent â€“ System metrics (CPU, Memory)
- Ubuntu 24.04 â€“ Base OS
- Git & GitHub â€“ Version control & collaboration

---

What This Project Does

- Creates an EC2 instance in `eu-north-1` (Stockholm)
- Sets up Nginx automatically with `user_data`
- Opens port `80` (HTTP) and `22` (SSH)
- Installs and configures CloudWatch agent
- Tracks CPU and memory usage in AWS Console
- Pushes all code and config to GitHub

How to Use

1. Clone the repo
2. Create an AWS key pair and configure your CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
Deploy it all:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform apply
Visit your server:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
SSH in if needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
CloudWatch Metrics
View real-time usage:

CPU: cpu_usage_idle

Memory: mem_used_percent
